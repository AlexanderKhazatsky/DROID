Follow these steps EVERYTIME you move a camera:\n\n\

2. Once the trajectory starts, move the gripper such that the board is clearly visible by the camera (1-2 feet away)\n\n\
3. Press 'A' to begin the calibration trajectory, the GUI will inform you if calibration fails\n\n\
Tip: You can name cameras in the parameters file\n\n\

* Finish trajectories in such a way that the robot can be reset (ex: nothing in gripper)\n\n\
