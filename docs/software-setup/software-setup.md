There are two methods of running DROID, one can run the application software directly on the host machine or through Docker. 

Running DROID software directly on the host machine requires additional steps in the software installation process but is worthwhile in the case where machines are dedicated to the DROID setup as it forgoes the need to launch and manage Docker containers. 

Running DROID software through Docker requires less manual software installation steps and allows for machines to easily be repurposed for other sets of software as application software isn't dependent on host environment configuration. Running the application software through Docker does however require an understanding of Docker the management of Docker containers.
