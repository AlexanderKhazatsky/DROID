## 👋 Welcome to the DROID Developer Documentation

This goal of this documentation site is to enable robotics researchers to:

1. Replicate the hardware of the DROID data collection platform.
2. Configure software to make the DROID data collection platform operational.
3. Onboard developers/users on using the platform and contributing data to the DROID.

The guides for accomplishing these goals are split into the following high-level sections:

* 🔨 **Hardware Setup:** a list of the required hardware (with links to suppliers) and a guide for assembling the platform.
* 🖥️ **Software Setup:** guides on configuring device settings and software. 
* 🤖 **Example Workflows:** tutorials for common workflows (e.g. data collection, policy deployment).
* 📈 **Dataset Schema:** an outline of the schema of DROID.
* 📖 **Contribution Guidelines:** guidelines for contributing data to DROID.
